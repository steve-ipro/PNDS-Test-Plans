The NYS Provider &amp;amp; Health Plan Look-Up was developed to make it easier for consumers to get information about health plan provider networks.  Previously, consumers who wanted to find information about health plan provider networks had to visit each health plan\u2019s website.

Network providers, sometimes called participating providers, are providers who have agreed to accept specific reimbursement from health plans for covered services. Seeing an out-of-network provider, sometimes called a non-participating provider, may result in higher out-of-pocket costs for the consumer or may not be covered at all.\n                                            top of page\n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                             What information is included in the NYS Provider &amp;amp; Health Plan Look-Up?\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                The NYS Provider &amp;amp; Health Plan Look-Up displays provider network information submitted by NYS licensed health plans for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), Medicaid Managed Care plans, Child Health Plus plans, commercial health plans, Commercial Non-MCO medical plans, Commercial Non-MCO Dental plans and Commercial Non-MCO Vision plans.\n                                            \n                                            top of page\n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                             What is the difference between \u2018commercial\u2019 and \u2018self-insured\u2019 health plans?\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            A commercial health insurance plan is paid for by an individual or an\n                                                organization other than the government and can take several different\n                                                forms, including: health maintenance organizations (HMOs) / Managed Care Organizations (MCOs),\n                                                preferred\n                                                provider organizations (PPOs), exclusive provider organizations (EPOs), point-of-service plans (POS), and indemnity plans.

Network providers, sometimes called participating providers, are providers who have agreed to accept specific reimbursement from health plans for covered services.

Network providers, sometimes called participating providers, are providers who have agreed to accept specific reimbursement from health plans for covered services. Seeing an out-of-network provider, sometimes called a non-participating provider, may result in higher out-of-pocket costs for the consumer or may not be covered at all.\n                                            top of page\n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                             What information is included in the NYS Provider &amp;amp; Health Plan Look-Up?\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                The NYS Provider &amp;amp; Health Plan Look-Up displays provider network information submitted by NYS licensed health plans for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), Medicaid Managed Care plans, Child Health Plus plans, commercial health plans, Commercial Non-MCO medical plans, Commercial Non-MCO Dental plans and Commercial Non-MCO Vision plans.\n                                            \n                                            top of page\n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                             What is the difference between \u2018commercial\u2019 and \u2018self-insured\u2019 health plans?\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            A commercial health insurance plan is paid for by an individual or an\n                                                organization other than the government and can take several different\n                                                forms, including: health maintenance organizations (HMOs) / Managed Care Organizations (MCOs),\n                                                preferred\n                                                provider organizations (PPOs), exclusive provider organizations (EPOs), point-of-service plans (POS), and indemnity plans.
